\title{Build multi-path forward selection using AIC}
\usage{
build_paths(
  x,
  y,
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial"),
  K = NULL,
  eps = 1e-06,
  delta = 1,
  L = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame or matrix of predictors.}

\item{y}{response vector.}

\item{family}{"gaussian" or "binomial".}

\item{K}{maximum number of steps (default min(p,10)).}

\item{eps}{minimum AIC improvement to expand (default 1e-6).}

\item{delta}{AIC tolerance for near-ties (default 1).}

\item{L}{max number of models kept per level (default 50).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{path_forest}{list of frontiers (each frontier is a list of model entries)}
\item{aic_by_model}{data.frame of unique models and their AICs}
\item{meta}{parameters and counts}
\item{fits}{named list of fitted model objects (may be many)}
}
\description{
A compact implementation of the multi-path forward selection described
in the project specification. Starts from the empty model and at each
step tries adding each unused variable to every current model, keeps
near-best children per parent within \code{delta} of the parent's best child,
and requires improvement >= eps. Deduplicates and caps models per level by L.

\dontrun{
forest <- build_paths(x = X, y = y, family = "gaussian", K = 6)
